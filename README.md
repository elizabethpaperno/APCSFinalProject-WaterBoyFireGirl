# APCSFinalProject-WaterBoyFireGirl

**Team Shark Boy and Lava Girl** <br />
**Team Members:** Elizabeth Paperno and Katherine Zhao <br />

**Breif Description:** Our project aims to replicate the ever-so iconic computer game, FireBoy and WaterGirl. This two-player game has a simple premise. For every level, get to the doors, while moving through the maze-like structure, avoiding all of the obstacles, and collecting gems. The challenge is having the two players work together in order to defeat the obstacles, which can contain anything from toxic lava to sliding levers.
