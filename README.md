This project replicates the iconic WaterBoy and FireGirl platforming game. It is 2-player game where the objective is to get through the obstacles and eventually reach the doors that mark the goal of every board/level. As you increase in levels, the obstacles gets more difficult. Scattered throughout every level are gems that should be collected by the player with the corresponding color, as it provides them powers and point when piled up.
